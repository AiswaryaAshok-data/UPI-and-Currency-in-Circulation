Objective:  The study examines the dynamic relationship between UPI transaction volumes and currency in circulation in India. Using a multivariate VAR framework, the study analyzes whether digital payments substitute or complement cash demand, while accounting for macroeconomic factors and structural shocks.



Methods used: Multivariate Vector Autoregression(VAR) ,Impulse Response Function(IRF), Forecast Error Variance Decomposition(FEVD)



Variables used: UPI transaction volume, Currency in Circulation, Inflation, Industrial activity, Repo rate, and shocks like Demonetisation and COVID crisis.



Key Finding: The results reveal short-term complementarities and substitutions between digital and cash usage, with cash demand showing strong inertia even amidst digital growth surges.
